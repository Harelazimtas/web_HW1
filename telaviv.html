            Tel Aviv-Yafo (Hebrew: תֵּל־אָבִיב–יָפוֹ‎ – Tel Aviv-Yafo [tel aˈviv ˈjafo]; Arabic: تَلّ أَبِيب - يَافَا‎ – Tall ʾAbīb - Yāfā), 
            often referred to as just Tel Aviv, is the most populous city in the Gush Dan metropolitan area of Israel.
            Located on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline and with a population of 460,613, it is the economic and technological center of the country.  
            If East Jerusalem is considered part of Israel, Tel Aviv is the country's second most populous city after Jerusalem; if not, 
            Tel Aviv is the most populous city before West Jerusalem.[a]
