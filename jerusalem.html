            Jerusalem (/dʒəˈruːsələm/; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם‎ About this soundYerushaláyim; Arabic: القُدس‎ About this soundal-Quds or Bayt al-Maqdis, also spelled Baitul Muqaddas[10][11][12])[note 2] is a city in Western Asia,
            on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity,
            and Islam. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim Jerusalem as their capital, 
            as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally.[note 3][13]
